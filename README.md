# hazard-indicator-IoT_Project1 

This application runs on the server and it generates data every 5 sec. The
Apparatus checks for Temperature Humidity, Smoke detection, Gas detection (nearly components
of pollution). When the working model is exposed to Smoke or Gas the embedded sensors detect
them and when it crosses the threshold it gives a warning by glowing of led. The Model also
shows the temperature rise and humidity so as to make a move before some hazard can happen.
This is a very good model that can be implemented in various places like Auditoriums, Theatres,
Class Labs, and House etc. and lives of many people can be saved. This is how we detect the
pollution and some action can be taken for rescue purpose.
